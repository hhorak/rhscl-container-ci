# CI Tests for Container Images Based on Red Hat Software Collections

This directory contains job configuration files, managed through [Jenkins Job
Builder](http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/), to run tests for each
Container Image based on Red Hat Software Collections.

Current list of tested images can be found in [Github team
repositories](https://github.com/orgs/sclorg/teams/container-images/repositories)
or in [configuration file](./configuration).

Now tests are run in two Jenkins instances:
* [CentOS CI](https://ci.centos.org/view/SCLo-images/)

  - jobs to test Pull Requests (test CentOS based variants of images)

  - JJB configuration file `jenkins_jobs.ini`

* Non-public Jenkins server (to know more ask hhorak@redhat.com)
  - jobs to test Pull Requests (test RHEL based variants of images)

  - jobs to build CentOS based variants of images on every new commit and
  push them to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/centos/)

  - JJB configuration file `jenkins_jobs_rhscl.ini`

All scripts, which are used by this repo, are stored in alone repository
[ci-scripts](https://github.com/sclorg/ci-scripts), so we do not update Jenkins CI
by each change. `ci-scripts` repository is cloned by each task in Jenkins CI.

## Pre-requisites

To use scripts in this repository to update jobs in Jenkins you need:

* `virtualenv` command, supplied through the `python-virtualenv` RPM

JJB will be installed into a virtual environment under this directory, so is
safe to run on any system.

## Updating all jobs

The provided script can update the Jenkins jobs over the API by running JJB.

    ./run.sh update

To access Jenkins using JJB you have to provide configuration file. So if
files `jenkins_jobs.ini` and `jenkins_jobs_rhscl.ini` don't exist they are
created from a template. Then add the username/password for access to Jenkins, edit
URL in `jenkins_jobs_rhscl.ini` and then re-run the command.

Note: [SCLo-sig](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/SCLo)
credentials for [ci.centos.org](ci.centos.org) can be found in the home
directory on slave01.ci.centos.org.

## Using run.sh

`run.sh` is simple wrapper for `jenkins-jobs` command. It supports `update`,
`test` and `delete` commands. And according specified name prefix of jobs it
selects right configuration file and adds `-r $THISDIR/yaml` to specify path
for commands.

To test the configuration of one job, run:

    ./run.sh test rhscl-images-ruby-rh
    echo $?

Once happy with the result, to test your config change on a single job, run:

    ./run.sh update rhscl-images-ruby-rh

During updating jobs you can select jobs by globbing. For example to update
jobs configured for CentOS CI run

    ./run.sh update SCLo-*

or to update the RHEL related jobs in different jenkins instance run

    ./run.sh update rhscl-*

## Generating jobs

Project files for each Software Collection Docker image in folder
`./yaml/jobs/collections/` can be generated by running `./run.sh`. If project
file for some line in [configuration
file](https://github.com/sclorg/rhscl-container-ci/blob/master/configuration)
does not exist, it is generated by substituting values to
[template](https://github.com/sclorg/rhscl-container-ci/blob/master/yaml/jobs/collections/template).
Each line of this file has format: "name namespace github_org github_project
triggering_project".

By default each project has these three jenkins jobs generated:

* *SCLo-container-{name}-{namespace}*: job which tests content of pull
requests in CentOS7. It requires to run on [CentOS CI
infrastructure](https://ci.centos.org)).

* *rhscl-images-{name}-{namespace}*: job which tests content of pull requests
in RHEL7. This job is *not* configured to use CentOS CI infrastructure and it
requires to run on machine with access to RHEL7 Docker image.

* *rhscl-images-{name}-{namespace}-build*: job which after new commit to
repository builds CentoOS7 based image and pushes it to Docker Hub. This job
is *not* configured to use CentOS CI infrastructure.

**Projects do not have to use all three default jobs. Some files in
`./yaml/jobs/collections/` can be manually created/updated. So be careful when
regenerating all project files.**

For regenerating all project files (if you really know what you do; see a comment above), run:
```
rm yaml/jobs/collections/*yaml
./run test
```

## How to add tests for a new image

When a new image is created and we want to add testing of it. Push/move image repository into `https://github.com/sclorg` organization. To enable CI:

1. Create jenkins job - the easiest way is to add a new entry to `./configuration` 
file and run `./run.sh` (missing project files are generated):

    `./run.sh update`

    Then a PR should include `./configuration` and the newly created file
    `./yaml/jobs/collections/<newspec>`.

2. In order to allow testing of the pull-requests, right permissions have be set. Add the **'centos-ci'** user as a collaborator to the repo and add the repository to **'Container images'** github team - both with **write** access.

3. To be able to trigger CentOS CI jobs add webhook for github repository:

    Payload URL : `https://ci.centos.org/ghprbhook/`

    Choose `'Let me select individual events.'` and mark notifications for
    `'Issue comment'` and `'Pull request'`.

4. If the repository is supposed to be maintaned (write/admin permissions) only by people from RedHat, add the repository to **'RedHat maintained'** github team. There is a jenkins job which check permissions for all repositories listed there.

## Branches in this repo

This repository contains three important branches
* `old_jenkins` - which did not use `ci-scripts` repository and Jenkins CI did not use OpenShift at all.
* `ocp3_jenkins` - which uses `ci-scripts` repository with branch `ocp3_jenkins` and Jenkins CI use OpenShift 3 and configuration is done as Configuration as a Code.
* `master` - which uses `ci-scripts` repository with branch `master` and Jenkins CI use OpenShift 4 and configuration is done as Configuration as a Code.

## Creating necessary credentials in Jenkins

**Jenkins jobs need permissions to access github pull-requests for two reasons:**

A) Update the status of the pull-request

B) Creating a gist file to share the job log, that is otherwise available behind a firewall only; and updating generated branch

All credentials, tokens and configurations are now hidden in secret repo.
Our Jenkins CI is now configured as Configuration as a Code.
